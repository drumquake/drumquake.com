    <h1 class="headers">360 PARADIDDLES</h1>

    The sheer scope of practice material available online can be paralyzing—independence drills, tutorials, instructional videos. You want to consume it all, but you just don’t have the time.</br></br>

The truth, however, is that much of it is variations over the same basic principles. What I deem to be the most essential of these principles, is what I call 360 paradiddles. It’s been around for decades: I just put a name to it.</br></br>

As you probably know, there are 4 paradiddles (L = left hand, R = right hand):</br></br>

RLRR LRLL</br>
RLLR LRRL</br>
RRLR LLRL</br>
RLRL LRLR</br></br>

Before you go off thinking that that sounds ridiculously simple, know that in this example, probably like 80% of what I’m playing is variations over paradiddles—varying between feet and arms; with and without rests; with and without accents:</br></br>

    <audio class="audio" src="audio/360-paradiddles-in-soloing.mp3" controls>Your browser does not support audio</audio>

</br>Here’s what it may have sounded like if I tried to give this performance without ever having practiced 360 paradiddles. You can clearly hear the difference:</br></br>

    <audio class="audio" src="audio/single-strokes-in-soloing.mp3" controls>Your browser does not support audio</audio>

</br>A good habit is to do one 360 paradiddle exercise after every time you’ve played the drums. Start slow, and gradually increase the tempo. Reverse it and go back down just before you reach that point where you start stumbling. Repeat three times, like in this example where I play RLRR LRLL on the snare and tom.</br></br>

    <audio class="audio" src="audio/paradiddles.mp3" controls>Your browser does not support audio</audio>

</br></br>The goal is not to get good at one variation at the time, but to improve your overall coordination. So make up a new variation every time you practice! Here are some examples of variations you may try (lowercase = leg, uppercase = arm, exclamation mark = break; parenthesis = accent):</br></br>

RLRR lrll</br>
RllR LrrL</br>
lRRl RL!R</br>
r(r)Lr l(l)Rl</br></br>

Make sure to vary which drum you hit to. One hand on a cymbal, and the other on the floor tom doesn’t sound very good, perhaps, but it will strengthen your limbs nonetheless. You may even merge together half of two different paradiddles RLLR LLRL!</br></br>


If you do this simple exercise two or three times per week, you’re likely to be way ahead of most drummers a couple of years from now. Remember, this is a routine you should keep for life. I don’t necessarily do 360 paradiddles after every time I’ve played, however, I always do some sort of endurance exercise.
